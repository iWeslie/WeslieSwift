 ## Timers in Swift
 
 ### Timer
 
 > A timer that fires after a certain time interval has elapsed, sending a specified message to a target object.
 
 * Callout(Feature):
 Timers work in conjunction with run loops.\
 Run loops maintain strong references to their timers.\
 A timer is not a real-time mechanism.

 - Important:
 With the effect of run loop, the effective resolution of the time interval is limited to on the order of 50-100 milliseconds.\
 You must always invalidate the timer object yourself to remove the timer from the current run loop(the same thread on which the timer was installed).\
 The timer doesn't attempt to compensate for any missed firings that would have occurred while calling the specified selector or invocation.
 
 * Experiment:
 Most common use. For those needs which do not require strict accuracy or time interval.

import UIKit
/// schedule a timer to the current run loop
var timer: Timer? = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 1.0, repeats: true) { timer in
    /// timer block
}
/// Causes the timer's message to be sent to its target.
timer?.fire()
/// Fire the timer at the secheduled date.
timer?.fireDate = Date.init(timeIntervalSinceNow: 1.0)
/// Set the timers tolerance, not accurate relatively when the tolenrance is under 0.1 second.
timer?.tolerance = 0.1
/// Temporarily stop the timer for future use.
timer?.fireDate = Date.distantFuture
/// Fire the timer again.
timer?.fireDate = Date.distantPast
/// Make the timer not affected by the scroll view or any other UI changes.
RunLoop.current.add(timer!, forMode: .commonModes)
/// Stops the timer from ever firing again and requests its removal from its run loop.
/// Once invalidated, timer objects cannot be reused.
/// Set the timer to nil to release the timer object.
timer?.invalidate()
timer = nil

 ### GCD
 
 > DispatchSource provides an interface for monitoring low-level system objects.
 
 * Callout(Feature):
 A dedicated background-queue-friendly timer.\
 Absolutely accurate without the effect of run loop.
 
  - Important:
 If you try and resume/suspend an already resumed/suspended timer, you will get a crash.
